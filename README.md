##Arrays Version##
**Objective:**  Create an app that displays a new fact to a user when they click a button.


**Requirements**

+ Use an array to hold your facts
+ Use a loop to cycle through the array to display one fact at a time

**Stretch**

+ Instead of using a loop, try to randomly select and element from the array.  

##Dictionaries Version##

**Objective: Create an app that displays a new fact to a user when they select a fact category and click a button**

**Requirements**

+ Use a dictionary where each key is a category of facts and points to a fact value.
+ Display the categories using a label
+ Make the user select their category by entering text into a text field.

**Stretch**
+ Nesting: Have each category key point to an array of facts, instead of a single fact.
+ Randomly select a fact from that array.
+ Utilize a UIPicker instead of a textfield to take the user category selection.
